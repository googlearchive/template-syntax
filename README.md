Template Syntax
---------------

Welcome to the example application used in angular.io/dart's
[Template Syntax](//github.com/angular/angular.io/public/docs/_examples/template-syntax/dart) page.

To run your own copy:

- Clone this repo.
- Download the dependencies:

  `pub get`
- Launch a development server:

  `pub serve`
- Open a browser to `http://localhost:8080`.<br/>
  In Dartium, you'll see the app right away. In other modern browsers,
  you'll have to wait a bit while pub converts the app.
